# fixins_POP (Fixes, configs and Installers to POP!os)
Fixes and installations files for POPos 

## For now:
Apologies for my lack of English in the code. Ill take the time to write some scripts in English soon, but for now, bear with me.

### Thanks.

## Scripts list:

- [x] Gnome Network Desktop (Flatpak).
- [ ] kde connect / gsconnect (Flatpak).

## Install Scripts:

Simply run "chmod u+x ./ScriptFolder/Script.sh" or a "chmod u+x ./**/*.sh" from Project Root Directory.

### Extra:
Scripts will request a superuser password.
